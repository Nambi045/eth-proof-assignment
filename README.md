# MyToken Contract

A Solidity contract for creating and managing a custom token called "bhardwaj" with the abbreviation "ABS". 

## Description

The `MyToken` contract is a simple implementation of a custom token on the Ethereum blockchain. It includes functions for minting new tokens and burning existing ones, allowing the total supply and individual balances to be managed. The contract provides basic functionalities for token creation, distribution, and destruction.

## Getting Started

### Installing

To use the `MyToken` contract, follow these steps:

1. Ensure you have a Solidity-compatible development environment set up, such as Remix IDE or Truffle.
2. Copy the `MyToken` contract code into a new Solidity file (e.g., `MyToken.sol`).

### Executing program

To deploy and interact with the `MyToken` contract, follow these steps:

1. Open your Solidity development environment.
2. Copy and paste the `MyToken` contract code into a new Solidity file (e.g., `MyToken.sol`).
3. Compile the contract.
4. Deploy the contract to your chosen Ethereum network.
5. Interact with the contract using the provided functions.

Example commands for Remix IDE:

```solidity
// Deploy the contract
MyToken myToken = new MyToken();

// Mint tokens to a specific address
myToken.mint("0xYourAddressHere", 100);

// Burn tokens from a specific address
myToken.burn("0xYourAddressHere", 50);

// Check the balance of a specific address
uint balance = myToken.Balance("0xYourAddressHere");
```

## Help

For common problems or issues, consider the following:

- Ensure that the address used in the `mint` and `burn` functions is valid and has the correct format.
- Verify that you have sufficient permissions to deploy contracts on the chosen Ethereum network.
- Ensure the balance is sufficient when calling the `burn` function to avoid errors.

For additional help, consult the documentation or community forums of your chosen development environment.
